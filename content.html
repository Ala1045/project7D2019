      <h2>WHAT IS BULLYING?</h2>
      <p>Bullying is when someone is rude or mean to another person. The people who bully other people are called bullies. Anybody can be bullied, even a group of people. There are many different kinds of bullying. Bullying does not always mean hitting people. It can also be things that people say. </p>
      <p>Bullying includes when people see what happens, but they don't do anything about it. When people who see bullying know what to do and they do it, they can help make a bad situation better. 
        It's also bullying when other people hide it from those who can help, when other people see it but ignore it, or when a person helps the bully to do it without getting in trouble. </p>

      <p>There are many different types of bullying that can be experienced by children and adults alike, some are obvious to spot while others can be more subtle. The different types of bullying that we look at below are some of the ways that bullying could be happening.</p>

      <p>Social Bullying - Social bullying, sometimes referred to as covert bullying, is often harder to recognise and can be carried out behind the bullied person's back. It is designed to harm someone's social reputation and/or cause humiliation. Social bullying includes lying and spreading rumours, negative facial or physical gestures, menacing or contemptuous looks, playing nasty jokes to embarrass and humiliate, mimicking unkindly, encouraging others to socially exclude someone, and damaging someone's social reputation or social acceptance.</p>

      <h2>EFFECTS OF BULLYING</h2>
      <p>Bullying can affect everyone—those who are bullied, those who bully, and those who witness bullying. Bullying is linked to many negative outcomes including impacts on mental health, substance use, and suicide. It is important to talk to kids to determine whether bullying—or something else—is a concern.</p>
      <h5>Kids Who are Bullied</h5>
      <p>Kids who are bullied can experience negative physical, school, and mental health issues. Kids who are bullied are more likely to experience depression and anxiety, increased feelings of sadness and loneliness, changes in sleep and eating patterns, loss of interest in activities they used to enjoy, health complaints, decreased academic achievement—GPA and standardized test scores—and school participation, and missing, skipping, or dropping out of school. A very small number of bullied children might retaliate through extremely violent measures. In 12 of 15 school shooting cases in the 1990s, the shooters had a history of being bullied.</p>
      <h5>Kids Who Bully Others</h5>
      <p>Kids who bully others can also engage in violent and other risky behaviors into adulthood. Kids who bully are more likely to abuse alcohol and other drugs in adolescence and as adults, get into fights, vandalize property, drop out of school, have criminal convictions and traffic citations as adults , and be abusive toward their romantic partners, spouses, or children as adults.</p>
      <h5>Bystanders</h5>
      <p>Kids who witness bullying are more likely to have increased use of tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs, have increased mental health problems, including depression and anxiety, and miss or skip school.</p>
